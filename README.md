# Lost in Steam 

*Randomly teleported into a video game, your mission is to guess which game you're in just by observing your surroundings. Once you've figured it out, score even more points by pinpointing your exact location on the game's map!*

Lost in Steam is a web-based game where players guess the name of a video game by exploring a 360Â° image taken from within the game. Once the game has been correctly identified, players are tasked with determining their precise location on the game's minimap to score additional points.

## In developpement...

Lost in Steam is still in developpement, but you can already try a very early access of the game here : http://89.168.50.154/ \
There are currently 28 different games available, with around 120 locations to guess, and more are on the way!

Future goals for the projects :
- Online multiplayer
- Leaderboard
- New game modes (e.g. sound-based or static image guessing)
